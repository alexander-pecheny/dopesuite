# XY — Implementation Plan

A Trello-style board app for ЧГК (trivia) editing, built by reusing `~/dope`
(Go + SQLite backend, vanilla-JS frontend, shared design system). The defining
difference from dope: **all user-entered data is encrypted client-side** with a
per-board passphrase, and (later) the app works **offline as a PWA**.

This plan reflects four decisions made up front:

1. **Milestone 1 = core encrypted boards.** Auth, boards/lists/cards/labels/
   timeline, client-side encryption, drag-reorder, test lists. Offline/PWA,
   encrypted search, Trello-API compatibility, and chgksuite import/export are
   sketched here but built in later phases.
2. **Key model = passphrase wraps a random board key.** Each board has a random
   data key (DK); the passphrase derives a KEK (Argon2id) that only wraps/unwraps
   DK. Changing the passphrase re-wraps DK without re-encrypting board data;
   sharing means sharing the passphrase out-of-band.
3. **Reuse = copy into a fresh repo.** `~/xy` is a new self-contained Go module;
   we copy and adapt the needed dope packages rather than refactoring dope now.
4. **Telegram login = reuse dope's bot bridge** (separate bot binary + shared-
   secret endpoints), with its own bot token.

```

**Trust model.** The server is treated as honest-but-curious: it stores and
serves ciphertext and the *structural metadata* needed to order, sync, and
authorize (entity IDs, parent IDs, positions, timestamps, types, member ACLs).
It can never read names, descriptions, comments, label text/colors, or
attachment bytes. Server-side ACL (board membership) and the passphrase are
defense-in-depth: membership gates who can *fetch* a board's ciphertext, the
passphrase gates who can *decrypt* it.

**Explicit metadata leakage (accepted for M1).** The server learns board/list/
card structure, item counts, positions, timestamps, authorship, label↔card
associations (as opaque IDs), and attachment sizes/mime. It does not learn any
content. This is the pragmatic tradeoff that keeps relational ordering, sync,
and realtime simple. Documented so it's a conscious choice, not an accident.

**XSS = total client compromise.** Because all crypto is client-side, an XSS
hole defeats it entirely. Therefore: strict `Content-Security-Policy` (no inline
scripts, no eval, no `wasm-unsafe-eval`), no third-party script origins, the one
JS dependency (`@noble/hashes`) self-hosted and pinned with Subresource
Integrity, and HTML-escaping discipline in all render paths. This is a
first-class requirement, not a polish item.

**No WASM anywhere.** The crypto stack must run with WebAssembly disabled (e.g.
iOS Lockdown Mode). That rules out WASM Argon2 builds; the KDF is pure JS
(`@noble/hashes` scrypt) and the cipher is native WebCrypto.

---

## 2. Cryptography design

**Primitives.**
- KDF: **scrypt** (passphrase → 32-byte KEK) via `@noble/hashes/scrypt` —
  pure JS, audited, zero-dependency, **no WASM** (runs under iOS Lockdown Mode).
  Memory-hard, so it resists offline GPU/ASIC brute-force of the passphrase if
  the wrapped-key blob ever leaks. Params tuned for a tolerable one-time unlock
  on mobile: start `N=2^15 (32768), r=8, p=1` (~32 MiB) and measure; the KDF id +
  params are stored per board so they can be raised — or swapped to another KDF —
  later without breaking existing boards.
- Symmetric cipher: **AES-256-GCM** via native `crypto.subtle` (random 12-byte
  nonce per encryption, 16-byte tag).

**Per-board key lifecycle.**
1. On board create, client generates random DK (32 bytes) and random KDF salt.
2. `KEK = scrypt(passphrase, salt, params)`.
3. `wrapped_key = AES-GCM(KEK, DK)`; a fixed `verify_token =
   AES-GCM(DK, "xy-verify-v1")` lets the client confirm a passphrase on unlock.
4. Server stores `{salt, params, wrapped_key, verify_token}` in plaintext
   (none reveal anything without the passphrase).
5. To unlock: client fetches those, derives KEK, unwraps DK, verifies token,
   caches DK in **IndexedDB** (survives reloads; see caching note).
6. Passphrase change: derive new KEK, re-wrap the *same* DK. No data re-encrypt.

**Encryption envelope (one canonical format).** Every encrypted field/blob is:
`magic("xy1") | alg(1) | nonce(12) | ciphertext+tag`, stored as SQLite `BLOB`
(or base64 in JSON over the wire). One `crypto.js` encode/decode pair is the
only place this format lives; covered by Deno round-trip tests.

**Key caching.** DK (not the passphrase) is cached per board in IndexedDB,
optionally behind a session-scoped flag for "remember on this device". Neither
IndexedDB nor cookies protect against XSS — the CSP above is the real defense.
Provide an explicit "lock board" / "forget passphrase" action that purges DK.

**Cross-board copy/move** is inherently client-side: client decrypts with the
source DK and re-encrypts with the target DK, then issues structural API calls.
Labels are reconciled client-side (match by decrypted name+color; create missing
ones at the target). See §6.

---

## 3. Data model (SQLite)

Ported auth tables (unchanged from dope): `users`, `sessions`, `invites`,
`telegram_login_codes`, `schema_versions`.

New tables (content columns suffixed `_enc` are encryption envelopes; everything
else is plaintext structural metadata):

- `boards(id, owner_user_id, name_enc, kdf_salt, kdf_params, wrapped_key,
  verify_token, created_at, updated_at)`
- `board_members(board_id, user_id, role)` — role ∈ {owner, editor}. ACL only.
- `lists(id, board_id, type['normal'|'test'], title_enc, rank, created_at,
  updated_at, deleted_at)`
- `cards(id, board_id, list_id, kind['normal'|'test'], description_enc, rank,
  created_at, updated_at, deleted_at)` — no title column; titles are derived
  client-side from the decrypted description (first words, then fade), like
  dope's table cells.
- `labels(id, board_id, name_enc, color_enc, kind['normal'|'test_taken'|
  'test_missed'], created_at)`
- `card_labels(card_id, label_id)` — plaintext association.
- `timeline_events(id, board_id, card_id, type['comment'|'desc_edit'|
  'label_add'|'label_remove'|'attach_add'|'attach_remove'|'attach_replace'],
  author_user_id, created_at, payload_enc)` — `payload_enc` holds the type-
  specific encrypted JSON (comment text; `{before,after}` for desc diffs; etc.).
- `attachments(id, board_id, card_id, filename_enc, mime, size, lossless,
  blob_ref, created_at, deleted_at)` — bytes live in the blob store, encrypted.
- `board_player_map(board_id, payload_enc)` — encrypted rating.chgk.info
  player-id → name correspondence used by test cards (single blob for M1).

**Ordering.** Use fractional/lexicographic ranks (a string "rank" à la LexoRank,
or float midpoints) so a drag updates only the moved item's `rank` — important
for cheap reorders now and conflict-tolerant offline merges later.

**Soft deletes** (`deleted_at`) keep sync/undo simple and play well with the
later offline outbox.

Reuse dope's **migration runner** (`schema_versions` + ordered SQL steps) and
its **write-tx discipline** (single write lock, connection acquired off-lock,
bounded tx) from `store`/`core`.

---

## 4. HTTP API (API-first)

Everything doable in the UI is a JSON endpoint; the UI is just a client. Request/
response content fields carry **ciphertext envelopes** (base64); the server
validates structure and ACLs only, never content.

- Auth (ported): `POST /api/auth/login/{start,password,code}`,
  `/api/auth/register/*`, `GET /api/auth/me`, `POST /api/auth/logout`,
  `PUT /api/auth/{username,password}`.
- Boards: `GET/POST /api/boards`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/boards/{id}`,
  `GET /api/boards/{id}/keymeta` (salt/params/wrapped_key/verify_token),
  `PUT /api/boards/{id}/keymeta` (passphrase change = re-wrap).
- Members: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/boards/{id}/members`.
- Lists: `POST /api/boards/{id}/lists`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/lists/{id}`
  (PATCH covers rename + reorder via `rank`/`list_id`).
- Cards: `POST /api/lists/{id}/cards`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/cards/{id}`
  (PATCH covers description, rank, move between lists).
- Labels: `GET/POST /api/boards/{id}/labels`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/labels/{id}`,
  `PUT /api/cards/{id}/labels` (set associations).
- Timeline: `GET /api/cards/{id}/timeline`, `POST /api/cards/{id}/comments`.
  (desc/label/attachment events are appended server-side as a side effect of the
  corresponding mutation, with the client supplying `payload_enc`.)
- Attachments: `POST /api/cards/{id}/attachments` (multipart: metadata + cipher
  bytes), `GET /api/attachments/{id}` (cipher bytes), `DELETE`.

Update propagation between collaborators is handled by the sync layer (poll /
refresh-on-focus, and the offline outbox in a later phase) — there is no separate
realtime push channel. See §6.

A later phase maps a **subset of the Trello REST API** onto this (boards/lists/
cards/labels) for migration tooling; deferred.

---

## 5. Frontend

Reuse dope's design system (`styles.css` variables, layout grids, `menu.js`
chrome, `login.html`/`login.js`/`profile.js`) and its no-bundler `window`-globals
convention. New modules:

- `crypto.js` — scrypt (noble) + AES-GCM envelope; `unlockBoard`, `encField`,
  `decField`, key cache (IndexedDB). Sole owner of the wire format.
- `board.js` — board list + kanban view: lists and cards, HTML5 drag-and-drop
  with fractional-rank reordering, optimistic update + SSE reconcile, derived
  card titles (decrypt → first words → fade). Decrypts on render only.
- `card.js` — card detail: monospace plain-text description editor, timeline
  (comments + desc diffs rendered two-up, label/attachment events), label
  picker, attachment upload (webp recompress, lossless checkbox).
- Unlock UI — passphrase prompt when a board's DK isn't cached; create-board
  flow that sets the passphrase.

Frontend tests in Deno (`jstest/`): crypto round-trip, envelope compatibility,
rank-insertion math, title derivation.

---

## 6. Special behaviors

**Test lists / test cards.** A list of `type='test'` holds `kind='test'` cards:
- Title is a date/time; "description" is a list of rating.chgk.info player IDs
  (stored in `description_enc`).
- Creating a test card auto-creates two board labels: green
  `"{yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM} взяли"` (`kind='test_taken'`) and red `"…не взяли"`
  (`kind='test_missed'`), which the user then assigns to questions manually.
- `board_player_map` resolves player IDs → names for display.

**Copy / move across boards.** Client-side re-encryption (§2): decrypt under
source DK, re-encrypt under target DK, recreate structure via the API, reconcile
labels by decrypted name+color (create missing at target). Carries description,
labels, timeline, and attachments.

**Attachments.** Client recompresses images to WebP q70 via canvas/OffscreenCanvas
unless "lossless" is checked, then encrypts and uploads ciphertext. Download
fetches ciphertext and decrypts in the browser.

**Collaborator update propagation.** No realtime push for now. Clients pick up
others' changes via the sync layer — a pull on board open / refresh-on-focus in
M1, and the offline outbox + reconcile loop in a later phase. (Live SSE co-editing
can be revisited later only if poll latency proves annoying.)

---

## 7. Milestone 1 work breakdown (build order)

1. **Scaffold.** New `xy` Go module; copy dope's server skeleton (embed, gzip,
   ETag/cache-busting, dev disk-read mode), `justfile`, `deploy.py` patterns,
   SQLite WAL + migration runner + write-tx discipline.
2. **Auth port.** `users/sessions/invites/telegram_login_codes`, login/register
   handlers, session middleware, `session` package, design-system assets,
   `login`/`menu`/`profile`. Port the Telegram bot (`cmd/telegram-bot` +
   bridge) with its own token.
3. **Crypto foundation.** `crypto.js` (Argon2id WASM + AES-GCM envelope), board
   create (generate DK, wrap, verify token), unlock UI, IndexedDB key cache,
   strict CSP + SRI. Deno round-trip tests.
4. **Data model + API.** boards/members/lists/cards/labels/card_labels/timeline/
   attachments tables + endpoints, write-tx, ACL checks.
5. **Board UI.** Board list, kanban view, drag-reorder (fractional ranks),
   derived titles, optimistic updates.
6. **Card UI + timeline.** Monospace description editor, comments, desc diffs,
   label management.
7. **Attachments.** WebP recompress + encrypt + upload/download; blob store.
8. **Test lists/cards.** Special list/card type, auto labels, player map.
9. **Copy/move across boards** with client-side re-encryption + label reconcile.
10. **Tests + deploy.** `just pre-commit` (fmt/vet/test), deploy script.

---

## 8. Later phases (sketched)

- **Offline / PWA.** Service worker for app shell; IndexedDB mirror of board
  ciphertext + a mutation **outbox**; background sync on reconnect. Fractional
  ranks + per-field encryption + soft deletes make last-writer-wins-per-field
  merges tractable; flag genuine conflicts in the timeline. Design the API now so
  every mutation is an idempotent, replayable delta (client-supplied op id).
- **Encrypted search.** Client-side index in IndexedDB built from decrypted
  content as boards are opened; search runs locally. (Server-side encrypted
  search is out of scope.) Possibly a future blind-index option for shared
  boards.
- **Trello API compatibility.** Map a subset of Trello's REST surface onto §4 to
  ease client migration.
- **chgksuite import/export.** Bidirectional conversion of boards/test data.

---

## 9. Open questions / risks to revisit

- **scrypt parameters** vs. mobile UX — needs measurement on a locked-down
  iPhone (pure-JS, no WASM/SIMD, so slower than native); start `N=2^15, r=8, p=1`
  and tune. KDF id + params are stored per board so they can rise over time.
- **Metadata leakage** (§1) — accepted for M1; revisit if a stricter privacy bar
  is required (would mean encrypting associations/positions and losing cheap
  server-side ordering).
- **Single JS dependency** `@noble/hashes` (pure JS, audited, no WASM) — vendored
  self-hosted and pinned with SRI; it's the only third-party client code.
- **Offline conflict semantics** — decide per-field LWW vs. surfacing conflicts;
  affects the M1 API delta shape, so lock it in before §7.4 freezes endpoints.
